# Embed a Tweet in your Post

###  Why Embed a Tweet?

When you embed a tweet, you allow your readers to use Twitter functionality such as reply, follow, and retweet without leaving your post. Embedded tweets also have a professional look and sidestep some attribution issues.

### How to Embed a Tweet

1. Find the tweet you want to embed in your post.
2. In the bottom right corner of the tweet, click the `...` (ellipsis or three dots) button.
3. From the dropdown menu, select `Embed tweet`.
