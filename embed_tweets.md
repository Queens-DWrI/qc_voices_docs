# Embed a Tweet in your Post

###  Why Embed a Tweet?

When you embed a tweet, you allow your readers to use Twitter functionality such as reply, follow, and retweet without leaving your post. Embedded tweets also have a professional look and sidestep some attribution issues.

### How to Embed a Tweet

2. Click on the tweet to make it take up your whole screen.
3. Copy the URL from the navigation bar in your browser. (It should start with `http://twitter.com`.
4. While editing your post, find where you wish to embed your tweet. Create a blank line and paste your copied URL onto the line.
5. The tweet should appear, both in the editing area and when you preview the post.
