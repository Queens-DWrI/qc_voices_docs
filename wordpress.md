# What's WordPress? What's Qwriting?

# WordPress

WordPress is software that runs on a server—basically, a computer that is connected to the internet all the time. WordPress originally allowed users to easily set up a personal blog, and provided a user-friendly way to add content as well as the design of the site. These days, WordPress is used as a content management system (CMS) for many kinds of sites, not just blogs.

There are two main ways to use WordPress: via self-hosting or through wordpress.net. Wordpress.net is a site that you sign up for, like Facebook or Twitter, and it allows you to manage your blog without worrying about hosting. You have to pay a fee for certain kinds of use, and your ability to add new functionality to the site is limited. The self-hosted version of WordPress is free to use, but you need to pay for a server to host it. It's less restricted, and you can do anything you want with the site, including adding plugins that provide additional functionality. 

### Qwriting

[Qwriting](http://help.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/) is a large, multiblog installation of WordPress hosted at Queens College. Like wordpress.net, you can use it to sign up for a blog that is hosted at the college. [QC Voices](http://qcvoices.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/) is a Qwriting blog, so to create and edit posts you'll be interacting with WordPress.
