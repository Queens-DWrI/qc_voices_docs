# Promoting Your Work

## Twitter

It can be a little hard to get your head around at first and maintain a presence on this platform, but most writers and journalists use Twitter to promote their work. You may want to quote others when linking to your post, since the right retweet can make a big difference in how many people see your post.

## Reddit

If you pick the right subreddit, your post can get a lot of milage, and maintaining a presence on Reddit is less work than maintaining a presence on Twitter. Yes, there is some bad stuff happening on Reddit, but the general tenor of the discussion tends to vary a lot from sub to sub.

## Guest posts

This is kind of an advanced technique, but it can make a big difference over time and also creates a new professional contact for you. Basically, how this works is that you contact a blogger who writes about topics similar to yours and ask if they would allow you to provide a guest post for their blog. Bloggers are always looking for new writing for their blog and are often happy to allow someone to step in for a post...they may provide some text that frames your writing for their audience. In general, this is how successful bloggers get started even noww, by being featured on another blog with a similar readership.This requires research and tact when approaching the other blogger. If you do a guest post on a well-traveled blog (not your own blog or a blog you're otherwise required to post on), then it will count as a QC Voices post as long as you link to QC Voices.
