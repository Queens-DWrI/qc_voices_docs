# Images Checklist

Consult this checklist when adding media to your blog posts:

4. Does each image serve a purpose?
1. Do you have a featured image that is 700 pixels in height?
6. Are any two images too close together?
3. Are images sized so that text wraps around them neatly? (Alternatively, your image can be large enough to occupy the full column width with no wrapping text.)
4. Are your images large enough? Do they appear blurry?
4. Do your images have a consistent aesthetic or color palette?
5. Have you provided attribution for each image in captions? Use the form `Image Credit: <source`
6. Does your feature image have attribution that appears at the beginning of the post, before the content? This should take the form `Image credit: <source>`
