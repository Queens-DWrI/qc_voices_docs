1. Do you have a featured image that is 700 pixels in height?
3. Are images sized so that text wraps around them neatly? (Alternatively, your image can be large enough to occupy the full column width with no wrapping text.)
4. Does each image serve a purpose?
5. Have you provided attribution for each image in captions? Use the form `Image Credit: <source`
6. Does your feature image have attribution that appears at the beginning of the post, before the content? This should take the form `Image credit: <source>`
6. Are any two images too close together?
