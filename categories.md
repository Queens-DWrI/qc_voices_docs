# Categories

### Changing categories in the menu bar

1. On the left menu bar in the dashboard, hit `Appearance > Menus`. (That is, hit Appearance and submenus will appear on the same menu bar, then click the Appearance submenu.)
2. Where it says `Select menu to edit,` choose `Primary`.
3. You'll see the current headings for the main page menu appear in the main area. 
4. Editing the menus:  
  * Move menu items around by dragging and dropping.
  * To move an item, hit the little arrow on the right of the item header and then hit "remove" on the dropdown menu that appears.
  * To add new categories to the menu, check the box for the category you want on the left and then press "Add to Menu."
  * Make sure you save your changes to the menu when you're done or they will be lost.  
5. To create new categories, first create a blog post with `Posts > Add new`. On the bottom right where it says `Categories`" choose `Add category` and fill in the name.
