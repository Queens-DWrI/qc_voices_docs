# QC Voices Editing Checklist

Topic Selection: (Consider these high-level questions at the beginning stages of the editorial process):

- How does this topic of this post align with the topic of my blog series? Why will my readers care about it? 
- Have I covered this topic or a related one comprehensively in the past? How does this specific post correspond to other related posts?  How can I set it apart or connect it to my other posts? 

***

Article Structure & Formatting: (consider these questions once you’ve decided on the topic):

- Why did I choose this format for this topic? Have I considered other formats (a list post, a link-heavy post, a post about a specific event, a personal post, a post that adopts another’s voice, etc) or am I just using this format because it’s familiar? 
- Have I included high-quality images or other visuals  (videos, embedded tweets, etc) where appropriate? 

***

Writing / Copyediting: 

- Have I included necessary background for readers (or at least links to places where they can find that background)? 
- Do the transitions make sense and flow well? 
- Does the introduction capture the reader’s attention? 
- Have I varied the length of my sentences?
- Do I use sentences with active verbs? 
- Are my sentences clear? 
- Did I include evidence to illustrate my points? 
- Do I need data, statistics, and quotations to back up my point? 
- Are there supporting elements that could enhance the content?

Attribution: 

- Am I allowed to use these images? 
- Have I attributed all images, quotations, data, and statistics?

Title: 

- Is the title compelling and interesting enough to get people to click through and read on? Does the title clearly point to a discussion that’s occurring online / on campus? 
- Does the title accurately reflect the content? Is it specific to the particular content in this post? (General titles should be avoided.)
- Is the title concise?
