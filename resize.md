# Resizing and cropping images

One tricky part of contributing to a blog is cropping and resizing images so they fit well in the design of the site. This isn't an exact science, and will sometimes try your patience as you try to get things looking the way you want. [Don't panic!](panic.md) Image editing is a useful skill, and the time you spend on it will pay off later.

## Using Pinta

For this section, we'll be using Pinta, a simple photo editing tool available for Windows and OSX. (If you have trouble getting Pinta to install on Windows, use [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html), which is very similar.) If you already have a favorite image editing tool, feel free to use that to resize and crop images for the blog. Pinta is much simpler to use than Photoshop, and is also free.

### Crop an image

1. Download Pinta for your platform [here](https://pinta-project.com/pintaproject/pinta/releases). Mac users also need to [download](http://download.mono-project.com/archive/3.12.1/macos-10-x86/MonoFramework-MDK-3.12.1.macos10.xamarin.x86.pkg) and install Mono first.
   2. Once you have Pinta running, open an image with `File > Open` and then pick your image in the file menu. 
3. You'll see your image in the center of the screen. To crop, select the dotted square icon on the top right of the Tools bar. (The Tools bar is usually on the left of the image view in the center.)
4. Use your mouse to drag a box around the part of the image you want to keep. Leave the parts you don't want outside the box.
5. Press `Control-C` to copy that section to the clipboard (or `Edit > Copy`).
6. Press Control-N to open a new image view, which should automatically be the same size as the cropped section in the clipboard. 
7. Press Control-V to paste the cropped image in the new view.
8. Press `Control-S` (or `File > Save As...`) to save the cropped image. You can overwrite the old image or create a new one with a new name. 

### Resize an image

1. Open the image you want to resize (see step 2 above).
2. Select `Image > Resize Image` from the menu (or press Control + R on your keyboard). 
3. Usually, you will want to resize to a certain number of pixels. Click `By abolute` size and enter a new, smaller size in either the width or height box. Let the program automatically change the number in the other box. (DO NOT set both numbers, this will distort your image. Set either height or width only.) Keep the `Maintain aspect ratio` box checked
4. Press `Ok`. Your image should be resizedâ€”save the new image with `Control-S` (or `File > Save As...`).
